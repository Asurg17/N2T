To run the program you have to pass prgoram 1 or 2 arguments: 
#if passing 2 arguments, they must be: the path to the directory where the vm.file is located and the vm.file
	Example: VmTranslator.py "C:---\projects\08\ProgramFlow\BasicLoop" "BasicLoop.vm" 
#if passing 1 argument, this must be: the path to the directory 
	Example: VmTranslator.py "C:---\projects\08\FunctionCalls/NestedCall"; *see that here we are putting '/' before directory name which is important
