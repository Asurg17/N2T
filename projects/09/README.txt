The dot below in the center is a pacman's brothen squareman. His aim is to reach the briliant which is located uperr in the middle of the screen.
But it is not so simple. There are some obsticles which squareman must not touch or player looses the game! 
If squareman reaches the briliant without touching any obsticle player wins the game!
